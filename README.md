# TM1637 Library for STM32

This library provides a simple interface to control TM1637-based 7-segment displays with STM32 microcontrollers.

## Features

*   Display numbers (integers and floating point)
*   Set brightness
*   Control individual segments

## Hardware

*   **TM1637 7-Segment Display Module:** A common and inexpensive display module.
*   **STM32 Microcontroller:** The library is designed for STM32, and the example is specifically for the STM32F411RE.

## Example Project

An example project demonstrating the usage of this library is provided.

**Note:** The example project is built for the **STM32F411RE** microcontroller. You may need to adapt the pin definitions and project settings for other STM32 models.
